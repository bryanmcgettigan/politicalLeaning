# politicalLeaning
Fun project that determines the political leanings of a reddit subreddit, utilising AI to estimate the average political leaning of commentators under the popular posts of the day

The program works by scraping the top 15 posts of a chosen subreddit, then taking the top 25 comments of each post and estimating the political inclination of each comment. Each post is classified into either left leaning, right leaning, centre or neutral based on the most common comment inclination.
