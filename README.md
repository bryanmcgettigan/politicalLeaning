# politicalLeaning
Fun project that determines the political leanings of a reddit subreddit, utilising AI to estimate the average political leaning of commentators under the most popular posts of the week.

The program works by scraping the top 15 posts of a chosen subreddit, then taking the top 25 comments of each post and estimating the political inclination of each comment. Each post is classified into either left leaning, right leaning, centre or neutral based on the most common comment inclination.

Here we can see an example usage of the program. We first test the majorly right leaning subreddit r/Conservative, then the majority left leaning political subreddit r/politics. Finally we test the r/cats subreddit and we can see the program determine that the majority of posts on this subreddit are of a non-political nature due to the analysis of the post's top rated comments.
